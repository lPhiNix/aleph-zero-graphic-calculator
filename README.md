Aleph-Zero is an open-source web graphing calculator that allows you to represent mathematical expressions in a simple and convenient way.

All calculations are performed server-side, making this application perfect for users who want a self-hosted open-source solution for plotting functions or for companies with high-computing-capacity servers.

The application has been built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for the backend and [React](https://es.react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for the web interface.

## Main Features
The Aleph-Zero Graphing Calculator offers a set of advanced and innovative features aimed at the scientific and educational sectors:

* Advanced symbolic computation (derivatives, integrals, equations, transcendental functions, algebra, matrices, and more)
* Interactive graphs with infinite zoom and free panning
* Visual and recoverable history of mathematical expressions
* Secure user management and session persistence

## Deployment and Usage
For more information on deploying the application, detailed features, and user manual, check the application's [official wiki](/../../wiki/).
